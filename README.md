# epub2cbz
C# program to extract .epub Manga and Comic ebooks into .cbz files, including a ComicInfo.xml file with chapter info, reading direction and more.<br/><br/>

![Main view](img/epub2cbz-gui_1.png)

## Prerequisites
- Epubs must be DRM-free and should ideally be in the format of "[Series] v[Volume].epub", for example "Two Pieces v69.epub" (both are optional, but are derived from the filename, if calibre tags are not found)
- If you download the smaller package (without "_full" in the filename), you need to install [.NET Desktop Runtime 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0). The program should guide you to the correct website, if it isn't installed yet.

## How to
- Start the epub2cbz.exe
- If in Folder Mode, click on the "Input Folder" button (üìÅ) and select the folder containing the epub files
- If in File Mode, drag and drop the epub files onto the main text window and optionally select an "Output Folder" (üìÅ)
- (Click on the mode switch button (üîÑ) to switch between these two modes)
- Enable or disable certain options, like creating a ComicInfo.xml file or extracting images. The settings menu (‚öô) contains more options (recommended settings are enabled by default)
- Click the "Start" button and wait<br/>

## Command Line Arguments
- "--simple" / "-s": Enable "Simple Mode". Only extracts images. No further processing is done. All images keep their original name. Very Fast!
- "--dark" / "-d": Enable dark mode
