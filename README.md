C# program to extract .epub Manga and Comic ebooks into .cbz files, including a ComicInfo.xml file with chapter info, reading direction and more.<br/><br/>

![Main view](img/epub2cbz-gui_1.png)

## Prerequisites
- Epubs must be DRM-free and should ideally be in the format of "[Series] v[Volume].epub", for example "Two Pieces v69.epub" (both are optional, but are derived from the filename, if calibre tags are not found)

## How to
- Start the epub2cbz-gui.exe
- If in Folder Mode, click on the " Input Folder" button and select the folder containing the epub files
- If in File Mode, drag and drop the epub files onto the main text window
- (Click on the mode switch button (ðŸ”„) to switch between these two modes)
- Enable or disable certain options, like creating a ComicInfo.xml file or extracting images. The cogwheel contains more options (recommended settings are enabled by default)
- Click the "Start" button and wait<br/>

## Command Line Arguments
- "--simple" / "-s": Enable "Simple Mode". Only extracts images. No further processing is done. All images keep their original name. Very Fast!
